        • Regularization: Ridge (L2), Lasso (L1)
        • Nearest neighbor and kernel regression
    Algorithms:
        • Gradient descent
        • Coordinate descent 
    Concepts:
        • Loss functions, bias-variance tradeoff,
        cross-validation, sparsity, overfitting,
        model selection, feature selection

 All notebooks were made in Pandas, Numpy and Scikit-learn instead of Graphlab and TuriCreate suggested by the course.
